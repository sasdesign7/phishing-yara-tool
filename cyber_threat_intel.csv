140,"Today, the number of total ransomware variants at least over 150, if not hundreds more.”  It’s reasonable to ask why ransomware continues not only to exist but to thrive.",[],[],[]
141,"The first answer to this, as we’ve outlined in our report, is that ransomware is a lucrative cybercriminal business model.",[],[],[]
142,"However, in addition to the human factor, there are technical reasons.",[],[],[]
143,"Specifically, there are three things that combine to make ransomware a particularly potent threat on the technical level:",[],[],[]
144," In some ways, these three points state the obvious.",[],[],[]
145,But the full ramifications and why these make ransomware hard to stop aren’t always discussed.,[],[],[]
146," The way ransomware works is well documented, but let’s recap here.",[],[],[]
147,Ransomware is downloaded to a user’s system and executed on it.,[],[],[]
148,"The way the attackers get the ransomware on the system varies: it can be through unpatched vulnerabilities, social engineering or both.",[],[],[]
149,The most common way ransomware operators levy attacks is through email or by web browsing to malicious or compromised sites.,"[{'id': 45848, 'label': 'attack-pattern', 'start_offset': 65, 'end_offset': 123}]",[],[]
150,The overwhelming majority of ransomware attacks are against Microsoft Windows systems.,"[{'id': 44606, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 60, 'end_offset': 77}]",[],[]
151,"Once malware is running on the user’s system, it seeks out and encrypts files and folders that hold information critical for the user, such as documents, business applications or even database files.",[],[],[]
152,"In some cases, the ransomware is sophisticated enough to target specific application files.",[],[],[]
153,"Most importantly, because the ransomware is executing with the compromised user’s privileges, any file the legitimate, now-compromised user has access to, including network shares and backups, is fair game for the ransomware.","[{'id': 44607, 'label': 'attack-pattern', 'start_offset': 63, 'end_offset': 92}]",[],[]
154, It’s this last point that gets to the heart of why ransomware is so potent.,[],[],[]
155,"From an operating system point of view, the ransomware IS the user.",[],[],[]
156,"Even though Microsoft Windows today features a robust user access control system, that system has inherent limitations.","[{'id': 44608, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 12, 'end_offset': 29}]",[],[]
157,"In the early days of Window Vista, Microsoft enabled aggressive security checking to ensure user-initiated actions were legitimate.","[{'id': 45849, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 21, 'end_offset': 33}
 {'id': 45850, 'label': 'identity', 'start_offset': 35, 'end_offset': 44}]",[],[]
158,"This was well-intentioned but ultimately backfired: users got fed up clicking “Are you sure?” dialog boxes and quickly disabled the feature, or just mindlessly clicked “OK” every time they saw it.",[],[],[]
159,Microsoft made reasonable adjustments so that these alerts are now raised sparingly.,"[{'id': 44609, 'label': 'identity', 'start_offset': 0, 'end_offset': 9}]",[],[]
160,"Although that feature was never enabled to protect user data files like ransomware targets, there is a clear lesson from the experience: too many security checks on user activity fails in the end.",[],[],[]
161," Bringing that lesson to bear here, the only way the operating system could protect against ransomware would be to raise “Are you sure?” dialog boxes on everyday operations against the kinds of files that ransomware targets.",[],[],[]
162, And this is where the second point comes to bear.,[],[],[]
163," Unlike other forms of malware, ransomware is very specific in its targeting.",[],[],[]
164,It goes after the files users are most likely to care about.,[],[],[]
165,These also happen to be files users are most likely to use on a day-to-day basis or that are critical to an organization’s operations.,[],[],[]
166,Extra layers of protection for those files would be incredibly onerous.,[],[],[]
167,Imagine having to click through “Are you sure?” dialog boxes for every document or picture you opened in a day.,[],[],[]
168," From an engineering point of view, this sole, specific targeting of files that matter significantly increases the chances of ransomware’s success.",[],[],[]
169,This brings us to the third point: there is little attack time wasted on files that don’t matter to the victim.,[],[],[]
170,Even a successful ransomware attack that is halted early by security software will achieve some level of damage – enough to make the victim consider paying the ransom to get the files back.,[],[],[]
171,"If user32.dll were encrypted and unusable, it would be a problem.","[{'id': 44610, 'label': 'FILEPATH', 'start_offset': 3, 'end_offset': 13}]",[],[]
172,"But when your organization’s overall accounting and audit report is inaccessible right before the big deadline, that’s catastrophic.",[],[],[]
173, The net of these three points is that ransomware is a threat such that focus needs to be placed solely around prevention.,[],[],[]
174,"There is no effective solution for ransomware at the operating system level, as outlined above.",[],[],[]
175,"And unlike other attacks, ransomware attacks can’t succeed “just a little.”",[],[],[]
176,"In some cases, a single file lost is more than enough to count as a fully successful attack.",[],[],[]
177," In some ways, ransomware is a threat unlike any other.",[],[],[]
178,Its impact and scope are both broad and deep in ways that are unique.,[],[],[]
179,"Because of that, from a risk assessment point of view, ransomware needs to be put in a class by itself – a class that acknowledges that the risks from a successful attack of any kind are very high.",[],[],[]

451,This post is also available in:      日本語 (Japanese)  Intro  ,[],[],[]
452,One of the most important “innovations” in malware in the past decade is what’s called a Domain Generation Algorithm (“DGA”)”.,[],[],[]
453,DGA is an automation technique that attackers use to make it harder for defenders to protect against attacks.,[],[],[]
454,"While DGA has been in use for over 10 years now, it’s still a potent technique that has been a particular challenge for defenders to counter.",[],[],[]
455,"Fortunately, there are emerging technologies now that can better counter DGAs.",[],[],[]
456, What is it?,[],[],[]
457, A Domain Generation Algorithm is a program that is designed to generate domain names in a particular fashion.,[],[],[]
458,Attackers developed DGAs so that malware can quickly generate a list of domains that it can use for the sites that give it instructions and receive information from the malware (usually referred to as “command and control” or C2).,[],[],[]
459, Attackers use DGA so that they can quickly switch the domains that they’re using for the malware attacks.,[],[],[]
460,Attackers do this because security software and vendors act quickly to block and take down malicious domains that malware uses.,[],[],[]
461,Attackers developed DGA specifically to counter these actions.,[],[],[]
462," In the past, attackers would maintain a static list of malicious domains; defenders could easily take that list and start blocking and taking down those sites.",[],[],[]
463,"By using an algorithm to build the list of domains, the attackers also make it harder for defenders to know or predict what domains will be used than if they had a simple list of domains.",[],[],[]
464,"To get that list of domains that the malware will use, defenders have to decode the algorithm which can be difficult.",[],[],[]
465," Even then, taking down sites that malware using a DGA can be a challenge as defenders have to go through the process of working with ISPs to take down these malicious domains one by one.","[{'id': 46124, 'label': 'identity', 'start_offset': 134, 'end_offset': 137}]",[],[]
466,Many DGAs are built to use hundreds or even thousands of domains.,[],[],[]
467,And these domains are often up for only limited periods of time.,[],[],[]
468,In this environment blocking and taking down DGA-related domains quickly becomes a game of “whack a mole” that is sometimes futile.,[],[],[]
469," Why should I care, what can it do to me?",[],[],[]
470, DGA by itself can’t harm you.,[],[],[]
471,But it is an important piece that enables modern malware to try and evade security products and countermeasures.,[],[],[]
472,The importance and usefulness of DGA is best shown by the fact that it’s been in regular and constant use since at least 2008.,"[{'id': 46125, 'label': 'TIME', 'start_offset': 121, 'end_offset': 125}]",[],[]
473,DGA was a key component in the Conficker attacks in 2008 and 2009 and part of its success.,"[{'id': 46126, 'label': 'malware', 'start_offset': 31, 'end_offset': 40}

 {'id': 46128, 'label': 'TIME', 'start_offset': 61, 'end_offset': 65}]",[],[]
474, What can I do about it?,[],[],[]
475," Because DGA is a technique the fuels malware attacks, the things you can do to help prevent malware can also help prevent DGA-fueled malware attacks:  In addition, new technologies are being developed that can more directly counter DGA-fueled attacks, particularly for organizations.",[],[],[]
476,"In particular, security vendors are bringing automation to bear to counter the attackers’ automation.",[],[],[]
477,"New anti-DGA technologies that leverage machine learning and big data are capable of countering DGA’s automation with automated prediction of their own that can anticipate, block, assist with malicious site takedowns or even, in some cases, prevent those malicious sites from being used in the first place.",[],[],[]

1083,"Far from the hypothesized ""huge amount of variability"" in mutex names, likely hypothesized due to the seemingly random appearance of them, practical mutex usage is embarrassingly consistent.",[],[],[]

1085," This blog was sourced from the data generated by the WildFire Analytics cloud, which processes thousands of samples a day and provides insights into various characteristics and behaviors of malware worldwide.","[{'id': 46564, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 54, 'end_offset': 78}]",[],[]
1086,"But before we get into the details, here is a quick overview of mutexes and why they exist in the first place.",[],[],[]
1087, The mutex is the fundamental tool for managing shared resources between multiple threads (or processes).,[],[],[]
1088,"If you think of the threads as a whole bunch of people in a meeting, all trying to talk at once, a mutex is the baton that gets passed from one person to the next so that there’s only one person talking at a time.",[],[],[]
1089,The important thing to understand is what the mutex is really protecting.,[],[],[]
1090,"In the above example, the resource being protected isn’t the right to speak, as many might think, but rather the ability to listen.",[],[],[]
1091, Here’s a more technical example.,[],[],[]
1092,"Lets say you want to update an Internet Explorer (IE) cookie file, adding a unique identifier for use later.","[{'id': 44932, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 31, 'end_offset': 53}]",[],[]
1093,"Naively, what you need to do is read the cookie file in, add your data to what you’ve read, and write the file back to disk.",[],[],[]
1094,But what if IE is running and also updating that file?,"[{'id': 46565, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 12, 'end_offset': 14}]",[],[]
1095,"The worst case, for you, is that both you and IE read the file at the same time but you write your edits first.","[{'id': 46566, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 46, 'end_offset': 48}]",[],[]
1096,This is because IE will completely destroy your edits when it writes its new version of the file over yours.,"[{'id': 46567, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 16, 'end_offset': 18}]",[],[]
1097, The solution to this problem is to use a mutex to protect the integrity of the cookie file.,[],[],[]
1098,A process that has the mutex knows that while it holds that mutex no other process will be accessing the cookie file.,[],[],[]
1099,"It can then read, tweak, and write the file without fear of any clobbering by other processes.",[],[],[]
1100," Since each shared resource can only have a single mutex effectively protecting it, leveraging that mutex is indication that a program will be using said resource.",[],[],[]
1101,"In the cookie file example above, just referencing the mutex protecting that file indicates, with extremely high probability, that functionality to change the file exists somewhere in the program.",[],[],[]
1102," Any given mutex, and protected functionality, can then be thought of as an independent library of sorts.",[],[],[]
1103,"Note that while the technical implementation may not expose said functionality as a normal library, such exposure is not necessary for the types of analysis performed here.",[],[],[]
1104,That library’s usage can be analyzed in terms of who uses it.,[],[],[]
1105,Simply put: malware writers leverage malware specific libraries and groups of like actors will reuse these core libraries when able.  The needle in a haystack problem forever plagues malware research: it’s extremely difficult to find reliable information with malware writers constantly working to undermine or eliminate that information.,[],[],[]
1106,"But, in the case of mutex analysis, the useful information pretty well slapped us in the face.",[],[],[]
1107," As can be clearly seen, mutex 2gvwnqjz1 is strongly associated with malware.",[],[],[]
1108,"In fact, we have only seen it in malware.",[],[],[]
1109," As is equally obvious, not all mutexes offer such dramatic insight.",[],[],[]
1110,There are many common mutexes shared across both benign software and malware.,[],[],[]
1111,"What’s more, they don’t all share millions of uses across both sides of the fence.",[],[],[]
1112," In cases such as these the common approach is to use sets of the data, in this case sets of mutexes, to create fingerprints of each sample and then leverage those fingerprints to extract higher confidence classification decisions.",[],[],[]
1113,"While this avenue of research is being pursued, it suffers from all the traditional challenges of big data research.",[],[],[]
1114,"In other words, it’s slow going.",[],[],[]
1115," In parallel, and to inform better hypothesis for the fingerprint generation, research is being done to determine how far single mutex analysis can take us.",[],[],[]
1116,The research is ongoing but the initial results are extremely promising.,[],[],[]
1117," The number of times any single mutex is used drops rapidly from the millions of samples down to thousands and from there, even further.",[],[],[]
1118,Tens of thousands of the mutexes have been seen in only a single sample each.,[],[],[]
1119,This results in a few hundred thousand individual mutexes available for further analysis.,[],[],[]
1120, What quickly becomes apparent is that a large majority of the mutexes provide no obvious means to automatically classify them as necessarily indicative of good or bad behavior.,[],[],[]
1121,"And, unfortunately, the ones, which are reasonably easy for a human to identify, are so for significantly different reasons.",[],[],[]
1122,"For example,  “autoproto_*”  -- More than 20 mutexes share that preface, offering a natural fingerprint.",[],[],[]
1123, “global\setup_028746_mutexitem” -- Associated solely with known malware digital signers.,[],[],[]

1125, Only the first of the examples had the mutex associated with a vast majority of malware samples.,[],[],[]

1142,The author simply rolled around a bit more.,[],[],[]

1152,These unique consistencies make it extremely improbable that two different people named these mutexes.,[],[],[]

1154,It's immediately obvious that the author didn't move his fingers/hands much while typing the first.,[],[],[]
1155,It’s obvious enough that the author likely noticed it when reworking this section of code.,[],[],[]
1156,It's highly improbable that one would see the second mutex and make a concerted effort to make it appear “less random”.,[],[],[]
1157,"And, as can be quickly verified by searching through standard virus detection logs, the mutexes did in fact appear in the hypothesized order.",[],[],[]
1158, The third is likely due to the lack of overlap between mutex names.,[],[],[]
1159,"However, the research necessary to conclusively prove this hypothesis would be very time consuming and provide little other benefit.",[],[],[]
1160, The fourth is likely due to the mutexes only appearing in a single malware family.,[],[],[]
1161,"If this functionality were available in some more open source setting, and was of even moderate quality, we would expect to see it used in other malware families as well.",[],[],[]
1162,"As this functionality has not migrated outside the Allaple family, either the quality of the code is bad (see: face rolling), or it's simply not available to other malware developers.  The fifth is very likely as a change to the specific functionality these mutexes protect, with every change to any functionality, is simply not a practical method of development.","[{'id': 46578, 'label': 'malware', 'start_offset': 51, 'end_offset': 58}]",[],[]
1163,"And indeed, as with the second hypothesis, standard virus detection logs prove that each of these mutexes do span multiple variants of the worm.",[],[],[]
1164, Mutex names provide a window into the entire development process and timeline for malware.,[],[],[]
1165,"Idiosyncrasies of the malware author become apparent, the evolution can be traced, the availability or quality of code deduced, and reuse of functionality made clear with a simple mutex.",[],[],[]
1166,No other currently used method of analysis offers such a personal view into malware development.,[],[],[]
1167, Mutex name analysis as a whole offers a unique look into the results of any sample classification system and the malware therein.,[],[],[]

1196,"The reason is because most SMS-based IAP SDKs include comprehensive functionalities to monitor, manage, and even intercept a user’s SMS communication silently in the background, without any user interaction or knowledge.",[],[],[]

1206,"The reason they are not marked as malware is because all SDKs require user interaction when making a purchase (e.g. user clicks on the agreement).  However, these IAP SDKs are very dangerous to users because of what they are doing with a user’s SMS without his or her knowledge.",[],[],[]

1208, All of the identified IAP SDKs use premium SMS to provide the IAP service.,[],[],[]
1209,They implement code that will send SMS to pre-defined premium numbers (Figure 1).,[],[],[]
1210,This code implementation is also abstracted in an interface for developers.,[],[],[]
1211," However, in addition to sending, all of these IAP SDKs also implement a BroadcastReceiver and register it for SMS_RECEIVED actions (Figure 2).  In addition, Umpay, WiPay, and NgstreamPay will also register a ContentObserver to monitor all changes in an SMS inbox (Figure 3).  ","[{'id': 46601, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 158, 'end_offset': 163}

 {'id': 46603, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 176, 'end_offset': 188}]",[],[]
1212,"After an SMS is received, these receivers and observers will check the originating number and/or message body, and block the SMS by some policies (Figure 3 and Figure 4).",[],[],[]
1213," For example, in Figure 4, the policy is defined as deleting SMS satisfying two conditions at the same time:  1. Message comes from the phone number “+8610658008” or “10658008”  2.",[],[],[]
1214,The message body contains the term “You will use” (translated from Chinese shown in Figure 4).,[],[],[]
1215,"Some of these policies are hard-coded in the SDKs, e.g., in UmPay; but others are pre-fetched from cloud servers that are operated by the SDKs’ providers (Figure 5).  ","[{'id': 46604, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 60, 'end_offset': 65}]",[],[]
1216,"Again, all the functions mentioned above run silently in the background.",[],[],[]
1217,"Except for LinkSMSPayment, all the IAP SDKs listed in this post do not notify the user in any way that they are taking actions against the user’s daily SMS communication.",[],[],[]
1218,Users have no idea if an SMS was blocked or if it was delivered.,[],[],[]
1219, All of the IAP SDKs in this post target Chinese users.,[],[],[]
1220,Both SMS sending and SMS blocking will only affect Android phones with a valid Chinese mobile phone number.,"[{'id': 46605, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 51, 'end_offset': 58}]",[],[]
1221,Some of them will even check which SIM operator a user is using (Figure 6).,[],[],[]
1223, An interesting observation is that half of these IAP SDKs implement the send and block SMS functions in separate codes.,[],[],[]
1224,"More specifically, the code was separated into two parts.",[],[],[]
1225,One piece is embedded into Android apps or games for developers as a part of the source code.,"[{'id': 46608, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 27, 'end_offset': 34}]",[],[]
1226,"The other piece is included separately in the assets directory in APK files, and will be invoked by Java reflection in runtime (Figure 7).",[],[],[]

1229,This separation of functions may be intended to avoid detection by security products.,[],[],[]
1230, SMS should not be used in payment or authentication for e-finance transactions.,[],[],[]
1231,"On the existing Android platforms it is very easy for any installed apps to send, intercept, or even forward SMS messages in background without any user knowledge or interaction.","[{'id': 46612, 'label': 'SOFTWARE', 'start_offset': 16, 'end_offset': 23}]",[],[]

1233,"For instance:  To improve the security of IAP, some payment platforms try to add a verification step in order to confirm an SMS was really sent by the user, for example, it will ask the user to reply with certain text that was sent to a phone number specified by the user.",[],[],[]

1544, How the Attacks are Carried Out: Via Email,[],[],[]
1545,These attacks begin with an email sent to a carefully chosen target in the agency.,[],[],[]
1546,The recent spoofed emails we have seen are forged to appear to come from Jane’s 360 Defense Events to tell the recipient about events coming up in 2018.,"[{'id': 46825, 'label': 'TIME', 'start_offset': 147, 'end_offset': 151}]",[],[]
1547, The figure below shows an example.,[],[],[]

1549,The attackers are relying on the recipient to follow the instruction in the email and click “Enable Content”.,[],[],[]
1550,You can see below what the spreadsheet looks like and the enable content button.,[],[],[]
1551,Clicking the “Enable Content” button is the key to the attack.,[],[],[]
1552,"While it makes the text in the spreadsheet visible and so seems to solve the problem, it’s a trick: It’s really running a program that silently installs a program on the system.",[],[],[]
1553,"This program gives the attackers complete control over the computer and can enable them to copy documents, usernames, passwords, account information and even take screenshots.",[],[],[]
1554,How you can protect yourself,[],[],[]
1555,There are several things that you can do to help protect against these latest Sofacy attacks and others like it.,"[{'id': 46826, 'label': 'threat-actor', 'start_offset': 78, 'end_offset': 84}]",[],[]
1556," With the public awareness of this particular decoy, it is highly likely that the Sofacy group will shift their attacks to spoof emails from a different organization to continue carrying out these attacks.","[{'id': 46827, 'label': 'threat-actor', 'start_offset': 82, 'end_offset': 94}]",[],[]
1557," Additionally, this attack technique is not exclusive to the Sofacy Group.","[{'id': 45056, 'label': 'threat-actor', 'start_offset': 61, 'end_offset': 73}]",[],[]
1558,"Therefore, these suggested actions can protect not just against these known attacks but others like it.",[],[],[]
1559, An unexpected email message with an attachment that says you should “enable content” has a high likelihood of being malicious in some way.,[],[],[]
1560,"If you get an email like this, you shouldn’t open the attachment and click “enable content”.",[],[],[]
1561,"Instead, you should verify that the message and the attachment are legitimate by contacting the sender in some way other than replying to the email (because replying to the email may go back to the attackers who will, of course, say it’s legitimate).",[],[],[]
1562,"Or, just delete the message and report it to your security team.",[],[],[]

In the vein of the holiday spirit, we’re providing a list of twelve short, simple recommendations that can help you have a happy, safe, and private holiday season.",[],[],[]
2968, 1. Use a Password Manager:,[],[],[]
2969,"Even though not all devices can use password managers directly, it’s still one of the best things you can set up.",[],[],[]
2970,PCs and Macs as well as smartphones and tablets increasingly support the use of password managers directly.,[],[],[]
2971,"But even for devices that don’t, you can and should use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords for use on all devices in its vault.",[],[],[]
2972,"Preferably, find a password manager that requires two-factor authentication.  2. Protect Your Home Routers and Wi-Fi:",[],[],[]
2973,"In a home of computers, phones, tablets and IoT devices, nearly always the common point is the home router and Wi-Fi.",[],[],[]
2974,"For most, it’s something they set up once and forget about.",[],[],[]

2976,"Take time to ensure you have a good, complex, unguessable password.",[],[],[]
2977,This is where a password manager can help.,[],[],[]
2978,"You may consider configuring it to not broadcast the SSID as well: that can make adding devices a little harder, but that means it’s even harder for people to try and join your home network.  3. Set up More Secure Accounts on Your PCs and Macs: PCs and Macs (both desktop and laptop) are still around and as important as ever in the home.",[],[],[]
2979,Take time to set up an account for everyone with their own username and password.,[],[],[]
2980,"Also, all modern operating systems allow you to make accounts “regular user” accounts rather than admin accounts.",[],[],[]
2981,Set everyone up as a “regular user” and set up a separate administrative account to use for maintenance.,[],[],[]
2982,"If you have kids, avoid the temptation to let them all use one account or accounts without passwords: this is a chance for them to start to learn the right way to handle passwords by giving them their own and teaching them to never share that password.",[],[],[]
2983,You can generate the password for them and retain it as the “administrator” if you want for monitoring.,[],[],[]
2984,This also is an important lesson for kids to understand that privacy on computers isn’t absolute: the admin can always look at what they’re doing.,[],[],[]
2985, 4. Prevent Lost Tablets and Smartphones from Turning into Something Worse: Portable devices means an increased risk of loss or theft.,[],[],[]
2986,"These days, our portable devices often have greater access to more sensitive information than our PCs and Macs do – in the form of mobile banking apps, wallet apps and stored credit cards.",[],[],[]

2989,c. Lost device location.,[],[],[]
2990,d. Deleting or “wiping” data if too many bad passcodes are tried or if you active it remotely.,[],[],[]
2991, 5. Protect your Data on Smartwatches and Personal Fitness Devices: Smartwatches and personal fitness devices are similar to smartphones and tablets and have some of the same features.,[],[],[]
2992,"In addition to using those features, you should take time to ensure you know what health information is being used and that the cloud account(s) these devices synchronize with have very strong passwords.",[],[],[]
2993,These devices gather some of your most personal information.,[],[],[]
2994,"In some cases, the most serious risk isn’t around the device but the data being stored in the cloud.",[],[],[]
2995, 6. Be Smart with Your Smart Home: Smart home is an umbrella term for a diverse set of devices that have one thing in common: they all feature some kind of internet connectivity.,[],[],[]
2996,Each and every device will have its own security and privacy settings and it pays to take time to understand those BEFORE you put these to work in your home.,[],[],[]

3988,It also establishes a few recommendations for software customers and vendors to prevent and mitigate attacks as well as improve resilience against software supply chain attacks.,[],[],[]
3989,"The three most common methods are taking over the software update mechanism to deliver an updated software with malicious code, exploiting misconfigured access controls, and targeting publicly accessible code libraries, and inserting malicious code, which unknowing customers then download to their systems.",[],[],[]
3990,The document also provides the following eight best practices for establishing a C-SCRM approach and applying it to software:  Incorporating C-SCRM across the organization; Creating a formal C-SCRM program; Knowing and managing critical components and suppliers; Understanding the organization's supply chain; Working closely with key suppliers; Including key suppliers in resilience and improvement activities; Evaluating and monitoring throughout the supplier relationship; and Planning for the full life cycle.,[],[],[]

5115,That's not how it works at all.,[],[],[]
5116,That's ridiculous.,[],[],[]
5117,It's absurd.,[],[],[]
5118,"[00:59] It makes for interesting cinema, just like the red code/green code in CSI Cyber, but it's not a reflection of reality and that's a real challenge.",[],[],[]
5119,"Because a lot of people don't have the experience of working with cybersecurity, working in cybersecurity, so their only perception is what they see either through media—you know TV, movies, books—or if they happen to run into somebody at in the industry.",[],[],[]
5120,So there is an overwhelming amount of sort of information or misinformation.,[],[],[]

5126,This is very much a dark industry.,[],[],[]
5127,And with that in mind we come back to the concept of lateral movement.,"[{'id': 51213, 'label': 'attack-pattern', 'start_offset': 53, 'end_offset': 69}]",[],[]
5128,"[02:22] If an attacker breaches into your systems, whether they come in like a fourth of all attacks do via email whether they come in directly through a server compromise, which is about half of all breaches according to the Verizon data breach investigation report or one of the other methods that is commonly used…then they start to move around within your network.",[],[],[]

5136,Once they're inside they move around.,[],[],[]
5137,So we need to defend in-depth and have really great monitoring and protection tools within our networks because of this challenge of lateral movement.,[],[],[]
5138,[03:23] Let me give you a little easier to digest analogy.,[],[],[]
5139,Most of us in a home have a grocery list and maybe once a week—maybe twice–we head to the grocery store and we try to get everything we want off the list and then we come back.,[],[],[]

5152,"That's just ridiculous, right?",[],[],[]
5153,That's absolutely absurd and cybercrimals agree.,[],[],[]
5154,Once they've driven to the store.,[],[],[]
5155,"They're going to buy everything that they need and everything that they see as an opportunity, right?",[],[],[]
5156,They are really susceptible to those end caps and impulse buys... and then they're going to leave.,[],[],[]
5157,This is how they attack our organizations.,[],[],[]
